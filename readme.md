# Charmeleon

**Charmeleon** is a user-friendly impedance 
visualization tool designed for use in EEG 
research with **TMSi Refa amplifiers**. It 
provides intuitive and clear feedback about 
electrode impedance quality, enabling 
researchers to quickly and confidently 
assess signal readiness before and during 
EEG acquisition. The application is highly 
configurable and supports different electrode 
montages out of the box.

## Features

- **Live impedance visualization** from TMSi 
Refa amplifiers.
- **Clear color-coded feedback** to indicate 
electrode contact quality.
- **Customizable montages** for flexible 
setup in different experimental 
configurations.
- **Intuitive GUI** suitable for lab technicians 
and researchers alike.
- **Modular design** for easy integration and
